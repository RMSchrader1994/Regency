                <p>Welcome to my website, dedicated to providing quality, Regency-inspired garb for the curvier lady in the United Kingdom.  My desire to create these dresses for others arose from my own interest and participation in Regency-themed activities.  That is, in addition to being a bit of a ‘Janeite’, I love a good Regency Ball (although I have to admit to lacking any dance skill whatsoever) and attend the Jane Austen Festival in Bath whenever possible.  Indeed, as retirement is fast approaching, I hope to attend many more similar events in the future.
                <br />
                <br />
                It was while attempting to source day-dresses, ball gowns and the odd Spencer to wear while attending such events that I realised there was very little available which was suitable in terms of size, flattering style, fit, and cost.  I found plenty for slimmer ladies, but not for those of us who may be a UK size 18 or over.  Consequently, I began to make my own, and following numerous enquiries from other like-minded souls, I decided to make my frocks for others who may be experiencing the same sourcing difficulties.
                <br />
                <br />
                This venture is very much in its infancy, so while there may not be a huge range listed at any one time this is due to the time it takes to produce the standard of finish I am attempting to achieve, together with the fact that I am currently running up my creations while continuing to hold down my ‘day job’ in the NHS.  As a rule of thumb, it takes approximately 10-14 days for a new dress to be sewn and listed.
                 <br />
                 <br />
                Please do not be disheartened if there is nothing available in your size or within your budget at the time of your visit; I may well be hard at work producing something that will be right up your street – so do visit again soon.</p>

                         <li>I am currently selling to the <b class="imp">UK, Ireland & the Channel Islands only.</b>  Apologies if you are overseas, but this is just too small a venture to be able to sustain any losses in transit, damages or return postage costs from other countries.  </li>
                         <li>Please be sure to read the information on <b class="imp">‘Construction & Fit’</b> before making a purchase, as these notes are VERY important.</li>
                         <li>If you have already made a purchase, it would be wonderful if you could email me a photograph of yourself wearing your frock in order to share with others, stating where and when you are wearing it, and your name.  <b class="imp">By doing so, you will be giving permission for it to be included in the ‘Gallery’,</b> so you may prefer to provide your Regency pseudonym instead for publication!</li>
