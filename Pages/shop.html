               <p>I cannot thank Emily Chalkley and the team at Cannon Hall enough (see <a href="./ULinks.html" class="shoplink">‘Useful Links’</a> for details) for their generous permission to photograph a number of garments against the fabulous backdrop of their interiors and parklands.  This is truly a wonderful, period resource and staff could not have been more helpful despite my disrupting their daily routine!  Similarly, huge thanks are due to my dear friend Mrs Dorothea Chamberlayne, who supports this venture and is seen here characteristically pitching in to present the garments.

                <p>This fully adjustable pink floral day dress has fuscia pink cotton trim to waist and lace finishings at hem & sleeves. It is made from what I can best describe as a light, cotton-rich upcycled fabric as from touch alone I suspect there may be a little poly in the mix.  Conseqently, to avoid any danger of ‘cling’, the skirt is fully lined in 100% cotton muslin.  Seams are machine-finished to prevent fraying, and there is a generous hem of approximately 3”. As made, the length of the skirt from the bottom of the underbust band to the lower edge of the hem is approximately 40 <br />
                The underbust is elasticated for adjustable fit, measuring approximately 43.5 inches when fully stretched.  The fullest part of the bodice, when measured front and back laid flat, is approximately 48” altogether.  The neckline is adjustable with a drawstring of Beresford’s ribbon.  There is a pin-in modesty panel included for the back.</p>

                <p>This Spencer is made from a heavy, stiff flocked brocade with a bodice lining in a burgundy / gold silky polyester.  The fabric was washed before sewing using a delicate wash cycle, but should probably be laundered separately in the future to avoid any colour run as it is a very deep shade.  The armhole seams proved too bulky to be bound, so are securely zig-zagged in place. There are gold-coloured military style buttons used as decoration at the underbust band and a small one as a closure at the neck.  A concealed hook and bar is used to fasten the Spencer at the underbust.
                <br />
                    When fastened and laid flat, the garment measures 22 and a half inches from underarm to underarm seam, but there is a little extra ease due to the fullness at the front for the bust.  There is a small overlap down the front opening of about an inch.  The best way to enlarge the Spencer if necessary in the future would be to cut off and finish the edge of the underband overlaps - thereby making the garment an edge-to-edge jacket, ideal for a couple of frog fasteners to be attached.  The sleeves measure 24 inches from shoulder seam to cuff edge, but these have been very simply finished with a turn over hem to make shortening easy; the only way to lengthen would be to attach a lace flounce at the cuff.  The measurement at centre back to lower edge is approximately 15 inches.</p>

                <p>This Spencer is made from a mid-weight cotton rich sateen which could be worn both in the cooler months and - because it is unlined – the warmer ones too.  All seams are bound, and the fabric has been washed before construction so there is unlikely to be any shrinkage.  Due to the sateen sheen on the fabric I would suggest using a delicate cycle and cool wash.  There is a gold-coloured military style decorative button at the underbust band which is secured with a concealed hook and bar fastener.  The olive green frog fasteners at the bust and top front are only lightly sewn in to accommodate adjustment to suit.  When fastened and laid flat, the Spencer measures approximately 22.5 inches from underarm to underarm seam, but there is a little ease due to fullness at the front for the bust.  There is a small overlap at the front opening of about an half an inch, but the underbust fastener could easily be adjusted to make it larger, thereby making the garment an edge-to-edge style (this would require re-setting the frogs, of course). The arms measure 23.5 inches from shoulder seam to cuff edge, but these have been very simply finished with a turn over hem to make shortening easy; the only way to lengthen would be to attach a lace flounce at the cuff.  The measurement at centre back to lower edge is approximately 16 inches.</p>

                <p>This fully adjustable pink & ivory striped floral day dress has ivory lace finishings at hem and sleeves.  The underbust band is finished with pretty machine-embroidery, but there is also an optional Beresford’s pink ribbon (loops are attached under the arms and at the rear) included for choice of wear.  The fabric is a robust cotton, so although the bodice is fully lined, it is unnecessary for the skirt.  French seams have been employed on the main seams; the armhole seams are fully bound.  <br />
                The underbust is elasticated for adjustable fit, measuring approximately 46 inches when fully stretched.  The fullest part of the bodice, when measured front and back laid flat, is approximately 50” altogether.  The neckline is adjustable with a drawstring of Beresford’s ribbon.  There is a pin-in modesty panel included for the back.  As made, the length of the skirt from the bottom of the underbust band to the lower edge of the hem is approximately 42”, but there is a generous 4” hem which could be let down.</p>

                <p>This flouncy, fully adjustable floral day dress has an off-white background with little sprays of green and pink flowers dotted across it.  There is pale ivory lace trim to the sleeves, and a gorgeous, deep flounce around the hem - both of which are finished with narrow pink Beresford’s satin ribbon.  Included, but not photographed, is a long sash made from the same material which can be worn under the bustline as an additional option.  As this upcycled vintage fabric was given to me, I cannot be sure, but am 99% certain that it is cotton from the ‘feel’ of it.  However, just to be on the safe side, I have lined the skirt with 100% muslin.  Naturally, the bodice is fully lined and the armhole seams are bound.  <br />
                The underbust is elasticated for adjustable fit, measuring approximately 45.5 inches when fully stretched.  The fullest part of the bodice, when measured front and back laid flat, is approximately 50” altogether.  The neckline is adjustable with a drawstring of Beresford’s ribbon with small, pearlised buttons at the ends.  There is a pin-in modesty panel included for the back.  As made, the length of the skirt from the bottom of the underbust band to the lower edge of the hem is approximately 42”, but there is a generous 4” hem which could be let down.</p>

                <p>This fully adjustable floral day dress with ivory background has old-fashioned, reclaimed deep ivory lace finishings at hem and sleeves.  The pretty polycotton fabric has been ‘rescued’, having had a previous life as a pair of curtains, but I felt it was far too pretty to pass by.  The bodice is fully lined and the skirt also has a three-quarter lining made from 100% cotton muslin.  Seams are finished simply with machine zig-zag stitch.<br />

                    The underbust is elasticated for adjustable fit, measuring approximately 43 inches when fully stretched.  The fullest part of the bodice, when measured front and back laid flat, is approximately 48” altogether.  The neckline is adjustable with a drawstring of Beresford’s ribbon.  There is a pin-in modesty panel included for the back.  As made, the length of the skirt from the bottom of the underbust band to the lower edge of the hem is approximately 39”.  Please note that, due to the limited amount of fabric available to work with for this dress, <b class="imp">there is no extra hem allowance to make lengthening possible.</b></p>
